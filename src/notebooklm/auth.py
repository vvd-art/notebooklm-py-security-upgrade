"""Authentication handling for NotebookLM API.

This module provides authentication utilities for the NotebookLM client:

1. **Cookie-based Authentication**: Loads Google cookies from Playwright storage
   state files created by `notebooklm login`.

2. **Token Extraction**: Fetches CSRF (SNlM0e) and session (FdrFJe) tokens from
   the NotebookLM homepage, required for all RPC calls.

3. **Download Cookies**: Provides httpx-compatible cookies with domain info for
   authenticated downloads from Google content servers.

Usage:
    # Recommended: Use AuthTokens.from_storage() for full initialization
    auth = await AuthTokens.from_storage()
    async with NotebookLMClient(auth) as client:
        ...

    # For authenticated downloads
    cookies = load_httpx_cookies()
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(cookies=cookies) as client:
        response = await client.get(url)

Security Notes:
    - Storage state files contain sensitive session cookies
    - Path traversal protection is enforced on all file operations
